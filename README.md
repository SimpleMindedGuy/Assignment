## Dsign choice
I used a simple card design for dispaly the books, for a simple clean look, but also scalable and responsive design.

## Notes 
The task is relatively simple, and it dose test skills well enough. 
however, I think the taks needs to have a set design for the developer to follow, so that more of the developers work, is directed towards functionality, and logic problem solving, rather than solving design problems.
